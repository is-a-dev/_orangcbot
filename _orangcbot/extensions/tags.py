Hey you! This is not a help channel!\n
We have a help channel for a reason, <#1228996111390343229>.\n

Because my ancestor, orangc, is a degenerate and the maintainers are busy dealing with him, we are unable to provide you immediate assistance.
ETA for merging varies between a second to a eternity.
Remember, a watched pot never boils, so why don't get your other work done and maybe your is-a.dev PR will be merged in that time? Hyper-hyper-efficient time management!
Maintainers shouldn't be spending all their time merging PRs and neither should you spend all your time waiting for it.
